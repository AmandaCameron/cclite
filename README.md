CCLite ComputerCraft Emulator
=============================

**Description:**

This is a ComputerCraft Emulator written in Love2D. It is not complete, and is still a work in progress.

I will not be handing out builds for this emulator. To use it, [download Love2D 0.9.0](http://love2d.org/) and use the build_src.bat to produce a .love file.

If you have installed Love2D you can just double click on the .love file to run it.

The [forum topic](http://www.computercraft.info/forums2/index.php?/topic/13445-lightweight-cc-emulator-download-now/) for CCLite is from the original author, Sorroko, and features in mine are not guarenteed to be in his, vice versa.

**NOTES:**

My fork of CCLite has a different save directory than Sorroko's version. Mine will save to the "ccemu" folder while his saves to "cclite"

TODO:

Add in virtual redstone system

Make Error Levels report C functions properly
